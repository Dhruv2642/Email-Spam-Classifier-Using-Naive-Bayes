# 📧 Email Spam Classifier using Naive Bayes

A Machine Learning project that classifies emails as **Spam** or **Ham (Not Spam)** using the **Naive Bayes Algorithm**.  
This project applies **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques to analyze and classify text messages or emails effectively.

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project uses the **Multinomial Naive Bayes** algorithm to predict whether an email is spam or not based on its content.
