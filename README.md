# 📧 Email Spam Classifier using Naive Bayes

A Machine Learning project that classifies emails as **Spam** or **Ham (Not Spam)** using the **Naive Bayes Algorithm**.  
This project applies **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques to analyze and classify text messages or emails effectively.

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project uses the **Multinomial Naive Bayes** algorithm to predict whether an email is spam or not based on its content.

## 🧠 Features
- Text preprocessing and cleaning
- Feature extraction using CountVectorizer
- Model training using Naive Bayes
- Performance evaluation and visualization

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- Python
- scikit-learn
- pandas, numpy
- matplotlib, seaborn

## 📊 Dataset
